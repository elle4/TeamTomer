## Project Description

### Problem
As new (or newish) to DH folks, hard to track down DH tools and platforms that will best suit projects. 

### Proposed Solution

Problems in terms access, permissions, rights. Planning between public / secret. 

Problems with partitioning. 

Database of tools? 
Dynamic format? Encyclopedia of DH tools, platforms. 
Audience: undergrad / grad students 
Crowd sourced?
Would help build curriculum for digital humanities courses. 

Linked to conferences/ ADHO

How would it be tagged? Organized? Described?

Mapping to different platforms based on questions. Branchings, tree diagram? Interactive. 

Blank areas where ideas do not connect to existing platform. Log in and vote on non-platforms. 

### Is there something like this already? (Environmental Scan)

We hope not. (There is) http://dirtdirectory.org/tadirah/content-analysis
