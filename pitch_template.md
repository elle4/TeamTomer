# Pitch template

## Project Description

*This is your elevator speech, or your brief abstract that you will use to hook people in whether they be funders, stakeholders or potential collaborators.*

Create 3D models of UI archive materials and provide information needed for printing via Murkutu site. 

## Challenge, Problem or Issue

*Digital scholarship addresses specific needs, challenges, issues or problems.*

- What set of challenges does your project meet?
- What question is your project trying to answer?
- What issue does your project engage with?

### Our Challenges: 
- Limitations of 2D. Digital renderings not as useful for analysis. 
- Pedagogy: Students have to look at photos -- again, not the best for learning. 
- Incomplete archives between institutions: can't compare like objects side-by-side, if housed in different places. 
- 3D printing is a reality in archiving. Ethics?
- 3D printing decontextualized from archives, targeted 3D printing enthusiasts, not museum visitors (creating a seperation). 

## Proposed Solution or Template

*There is no one way to address a set of questions, but there is your way! How will you go about solving the problem or engaging with the question?*

- building a new tool
- creating a different platform
- producing a new set of workflows
- linking together content in new ways

### Our solution: 
Create a digital archive with 3D printing information. 3D printing information will have Murkutu protocols, so that there is another level of controlled access with the 3D modelling (for example, a photo that is public access could potentially link to a 3D model file that is community-only). 

## Environmental scan

*Chances are other people have had similar challenges or are tackling similar or related problems or issues. An environmental scan is a detailed look at:*
- Work-to-date that deals with your topic (i.e.â€”has a similar focus, set of inquiries or shares similar content)
- Tools that engage with your problem/solution
- Similar projects

*Your pitch should engage with at least 3*

### Our environmental scan: 
Museums are putting information for creating 3D models on the internet with public access, with varying strategies and results. 

Good practices? Smithsonian incorporates 3D model information into ebook about the content. 
Museum in a box. Rent a box with 3D scans and materials to do a VR scan to recontextualize. Raspberry pi. 
Not best practice? Met puts 3D model info on thingverse -- only 1 follower, 1 create. 

## Sustainability

*All digital scholarship must engage with the question of sustainability.*

- Who or what institution will host your project? Is there a cost?
- What tools or infrastructure is needed to maintain your project?
- What people and communities are need to engage and maintain the project?
- What might be the needs in five years for people to continue to use, engage with or build on your project?
- Is the initial scope realistic?
- Is the data in a transferable, re-usable format?

### Our sustainability plan:
