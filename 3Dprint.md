## 3D printing archive?

## Problem
- 3d archives may not be critical in terms of access / ethics
- digitial divorces material


## Solution?
Attaching instructions for 3D printing to an online collection. 
Helpful for teaching collection.

Using digital technology for materiality. 

### Environment scan

Smithsonian makes 3d info available
Museums are using 3d printing for various reason. 

# Some Examples
1.  Scan the World:  https://www.myminifactory.com/category/scan-the-world
-downloadable 3d models of famous artwork from museums around the world. 
-colaborative project 
-pretty targeted at people who are already into 3d printing and not so much at general public or for educational purposes

2.  Sketchfab for Cultural Heritage:  https://sketchfab.com/museums
- over 30 museums
- 3d models, photogrammetry, VR
- didn't see many printable 3d models to download

3.  American Fossils:  https://africanfossils.org/
- 3d digital collection of fossils with links to download 3d printing file...so pretty much what we were talking about
- you have to log in to download printing files
# So maybe this idea is already a thing too??
